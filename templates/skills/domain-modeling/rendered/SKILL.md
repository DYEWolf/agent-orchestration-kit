## Orca execution overlay

The following rules are part of this installed skill and override conflicting
instructions in the upstream body below.

- The coordinator owns the user conversation, GitHub Issue state, Orca Run and
  Task DAG, worktree placement, gates, and final integration decisions.
- A dispatched worker performs only its bounded Task. It does not create Runs,
  Tasks, worktrees, branches, nested agents, or background agents.
- Where the upstream text says to call a Skill tool, invoke a named installed
  skill through the current harness's supported skill discovery. A worker asks
  its coordinator when another Task or skill invocation is required.
- Where the upstream text says to ask or wait for the user, the coordinator uses
  the user conversation; a worker uses the Orca ask/reply flow.
- Where the upstream text says to spawn a subagent, background agent, or parallel
  reviewer, the coordinator creates bounded Orca Tasks and Dispatches. Workers
  never nest delegation.
- Repository mutations such as assignment, Issue updates, commits, staging,
  branching, or conflict continuation happen only when the Task contract assigns
  them to that actor. The CLI itself never commits, pushes, branches, or opens a
  pull request.
- A worker completes its Dispatch exactly once with concrete evidence and stops.
  Review workers report `SHIP`, `FIX_FIRST`, or `RETHINK` and do not implement
  their own corrections.
- GitHub tracker operations follow `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. Do not fall
  back to a local Markdown tracker in this installation.

The remaining section is the pinned upstream procedure, adapted only by the
recorded maintainer patch shipped with this snapshot.

## Pinned upstream procedure

# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `CONTEXT.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).
