description: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document for
  another agent to pick up.

## Orca execution overlay

The following rules are part of this installed skill and override conflicting
instructions in the upstream body below.

- The coordinator owns the user conversation, GitHub Issue state, Orca Run and
  Task DAG, worktree placement, gates, and final integration decisions.
- A dispatched worker performs only its bounded Task. It does not create Runs,
  Tasks, worktrees, branches, nested agents, or background agents.
- Where the upstream text says to call a Skill tool, invoke a named installed
  skill through the current harness's supported skill discovery. A worker asks
  its coordinator when another Task or skill invocation is required.
- Where the upstream text says to ask or wait for the user, the coordinator uses
  the user conversation; a worker uses the Orca ask/reply flow.
- Where the upstream text says to spawn a subagent, background agent, or parallel
  reviewer, the coordinator creates bounded Orca Tasks and Dispatches. Workers
  never nest delegation.
- Repository mutations such as assignment, Issue updates, commits, staging,
  branching, or conflict continuation happen only when the Task contract assigns
  them to that actor. The CLI itself never commits, pushes, branches, or opens a
  pull request.
- A worker completes its Dispatch exactly once with concrete evidence and stops.
  Review workers report `SHIP`, `FIX_FIRST`, or `RETHINK` and do not implement
  their own corrections.
- GitHub tracker operations follow `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. Do not fall
  back to a local Markdown tracker in this installation.

The remaining section is the pinned upstream procedure, adapted only by the
recorded maintainer patch shipped with this snapshot.

## Pinned upstream procedure

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS - not the current workspace.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, naming which skills the next agent should call the Skill tool for.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
